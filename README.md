The band/client are a group dedicated to just playing for fun but just recently they have not had as many bookings as they had hoped for. Their goal is to have at least one booking per month. For them playing means more than the money. Their current website was set up by one of the band members, a standard wordpress template.

Having interviewed Paul I learned that the band are deadly serious about their music in that music is a part of their dna. Because of the band some of the members have been able to get through the bad times more easily.

They need something more:
Modern clean happy fresh, retro
new logo design with slogan
Easy to use with the everything on one page but also a simple navigation.
