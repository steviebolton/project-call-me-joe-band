# The assignment 
The band "Just call Call me Joe" are a group dedicated to playing for fun but just recently they have not had as many bookings as they had hoped for. Their goal was or is to have at least one booking per month. For them playing means more than the money. Their current website was set up by one of the band members, a standard wordpress template.

Having interviewed Paul I learned that the band are deadly serious about their music. 
The existance of the band has helped the members through good and bad times and has made them friends for life.
But the band needed to adjust their image slightly by making the website more appealing: ie.: 
Modern Clean, Happy, Fresh, Professional and lastly easy to maintain.

new logo design with slogan
Easy to use with the everything on one page but also a simple navigation.
